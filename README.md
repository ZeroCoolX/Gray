# Gray

Due to a kernal crash and later complete logic board failure I no longer have the code for this project (sadly I did not use version control for this project at the time) but as development commenced I regularly recorded videos or created playable installers for friends and coworkers. Also attached is the original conception and ideas involved in the making of Gray.

Concepts, mechanics, videos of gameplay, and playable installers can be found on my Google Drive with the link below
